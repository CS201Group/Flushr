# Flushr

The purpose of Flushr is to make it easy for people to find bathrooms near them. The features in Flushr will allow users to find bathrooms based on proximity, different rankings (rating, wait time, etc.), and as well as leave ratings on these bathrooms for others to see. For the purpose of this application, we will only be implementing public bathrooms on USC’s campus (including the USC Village).

Flushr will include a map showing the locations of bathrooms in the user’s area. Users will be able to search for bathrooms, with options to sort the results by proximity, cleanliness, availability, and accessibility. Users will be able to view the information for each bathroom (provided through user ratings). Logged in users will be able to leave ratings on the bathroom’s cleanliness, availability, and accessibility.
